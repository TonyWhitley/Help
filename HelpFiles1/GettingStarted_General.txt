Startup issues<br>
------------------<br>
If the app refuses to start, or starts then closes itself, try deleting the app's configuration files. To do this go to C:\Users\[user name]\AppData\Local\Britton_IT_Ltd\ and delete all the subfolders in there. This will reset all the app's settings to default. Note that the 'AppData' folder is hidden by default on Windows - you may need to change the View settings in the File Explorer Options from Windows Control Panel - look for a setting called "Show hidden files and folders".<br>
<br>
There may also be an error logged in the Windows Event logs - look for .Net errors in the Application Logs section.<br>
