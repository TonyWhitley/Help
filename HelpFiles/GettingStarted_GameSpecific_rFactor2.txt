You need Vytautas Leonavicius' plugin for rFactor 2. The app will check if this plugin is installed in the correct game folder. If it isn't, the app will offer to install it for you when you start the app with rF2 selected. In most cases all you need do is click the "OK" button in the popup.<br>
<br>
If this process fails for any reason, copy the rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll from the app's plugins folder - usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Britton IT Ltd\CrewChiefV4\plugins\rFactor 2\Bin64\Plugins\rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll to the rFactor2 'Plugins' folder (usually something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\rFactor2\Bin64\Plugins). You need to enable this plugin from the game's Options->Plugins UI.<br>
<br>
Note: 32 bit rFactor 2 is no longer supported.<br>
